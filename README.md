# Schoenberg's curve
## Program for drawing the Schoenberg's curve for Class 396: Directed Undergraduate Research

### Schoenberg's Curve:
A continuous and onto mapping from unit segment (or [0,1]) to unit square ([0,1] x [0,1]).

### Purpose:
Because it is hard to visualize the geometric representation of the Schoenberg's curve, this program is created to allow users trace the process of drawing that curve

### How to run:
- Download/Clone this repository
- Run `make drawSBcurve`
- Run `./drawSBcurve`and enter 3 values: iterator n of the function, total number of points you want to draw, and number of points increasing each time you hit `Space`
- Hit `Space` to tell the program to draw more points
